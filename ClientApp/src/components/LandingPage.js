      <h2>Defining your day and your future:</h2>
      <p>
        I define high performance as reaching and sustaining long-term success,
        while also maintaining well being and positive relationships. That last
        part is important. People often assume you have to compromise your
        health or relationships in order to succeed at high levels but the
        research doesn't support this. With the right life habits and daily
        pracitices, you can achieve your dreams, out perform your yesterdays and
        grow faster then you ever imagined, and strive with true joy and
        fulfillment. Of course everyone wants to be successful. But few people
        create the right mindset, set real priorities, define what's meaningful
        to them, and review their day and performance in measurable ways that
        can propel their growth. I've found that most prople don't ever know the
        basic planning and prioritization strageties that lead to long-term
        success. That's why I created The Compass. I wanted you to have a proven
        and strategic approach to developing yourself and achieving your goals.
        I wanted to help instill thinking patterns and practices of some of the
        most high performing individuals in the world today and bring some of
        that to your daily life.
